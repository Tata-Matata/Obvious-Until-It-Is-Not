# Obvious, Until It Is Not
## And sometimes obvious in retrospect

Collection of technical explanations for things that often feel *obvious* — until you look closer.
Answers to questions that may seem naïve, trivial, or even embarrassing to ask at first glance, but lead to a deeper understanding when examined in detail.

When learning new concepts under time pressure, I often gain a general understanding — enough to move forward and solve the immediate problem — relying on best practices or documentation without always questioning the underlying rationale. The deeper *why*, *how exactly*, and *what happens if* questions get postponed — not because they are unimportant, but because there is not always time to dig into the details.

Sometimes, the questions are about topics learned long ago as a computer science student, then forgotten simply because they were never needed in day-to-day work. 
When faced with new technical challenges, those foundations need to be revisited and refreshed. 

Over time, those postponed questions accumulate. This project exists to revisit them.

## The topics here usually fall into one of these situations:


1. **Seemed obvious at first, but turned out not to be**  
   Something was accepted as “understood”, but later revealed hidden complexity, edge cases, or trade-offs.

2. **Not obvious at the time, but obvious in retrospect**  
   A concept felt confusing or abstract until a proper explanation made it click — after which it suddenly seemed simple.
   
3. **Foundational concepts revisited**
Topics learned years ago, but left unused in daily work, that need to be refreshed when facing new technical challenges.

4. **Seemingly naïve, first-principles questions that come with an embarrassing “I should probably know this by now…”**
Questions that sound child-like or overly simple at first (e.g., “Could the Internet be completely wireless?”), but help build an understanding of the important principles behind how certain systems work.

## Philosophy

This repository treats partial understanding as a normal and rational state under real-world constraints, and curiosity as something worth returning to once time allows.

The goal is not memorization, but clarity:
to understand *why things work the way they do*, not just *that they work*.
